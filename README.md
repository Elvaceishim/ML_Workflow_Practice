# California Housing Regression (ML Workflow Project)

This notebook and the mini-project within it serve as a means for me to practice the full workflow of training a machine learning model. This project trains and evaluates multiple regression models on the California housing dataset.

**Key highlights:**
- End-to-end ML pipeline (scaling, training, tuning)
- Random Forest achieved R² = 0.97 and RMSE = $18.8k
- Feature importance: Median Income, Latitude, Longitude, Avg Occupancy
- Tools: scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib
